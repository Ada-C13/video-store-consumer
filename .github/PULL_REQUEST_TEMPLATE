For each person in your pair, describe something you learned from your partner during this project | Antonia - I was very rusty in React and Kate helped me make sense of some React basics, she was very patient and helpful! // Kate - I already knew that Antonia's patience, energy, willingness to help with anything would make this pair project experience honestly wonderful. I learned that steadily going through the project, discussing the code, having mutual trust and respect makes a whole world of difference in the learning process. With Antonia, I am never afraid to guess or try something out, she is a judgement-free zone. |
What was one area of React you gained more clarity on during this assignment? | Antonia- The way I initially set up the project was not the best way to go about it, which caused some difficulties. I got a better sense of React design patterns due to trial and error (and TA Ansel)  // Kate- Oh, these are what props are and this is where they all go! Also, return is where the HTML goes which is equivalent to the view in rails. I miss Rails. |
Describe how you solved the problem of having lists of movies that look mostly the same but have different content | We used distinct components to deal with different functionalities and that those dealt with the lists of movies in their own way. |
Describe how you handled rentals with React | We made rental its own component and passed in props that would make a rental valid, a movie and a customer. Within rental, we had a button that confirmed rentals that resulted in a message if rentals were successfully checked out. |
Describe a DOM event your application handled | We have a button where when you hover over it, it turns a certain color to indicate "hey the cursor is on the Customer". |
Did you use any functional stateless components? What for? | Yes, for movie, customer, currentlycheckedout. These are functional but do not have states. 
Did you use any container components? What for? | Container components are mostly concerned with the “backend” operations. MovieIndex would count as a container that does that axios request. Presentational components are mostly concerned with generating some markup to be outputted.
They don’t manage any kind of state, except for state related to the presentation. Movie.js would be the presentational component. |
Do you have any recommendations on how we could improve this project for the next cohort? | Instead of going into React right after the one week of html/css with the personal portfolio project, it might be better for our memory to go into Ruby on Rails then have a few consecutive weeks of React. Seems like moving into Ruby on Rails makes a little more sense especially when we were doing Ruby for weeks. Even though there are trillion folders knowing there's a model-view-controller structure would translate a little better conceptually for React. Recalling React was extremely difficult after interviews and BEtsy. This would mean shifting things around, probably cutting out a few projects to give everyone more time for concepts to sink in. |
